A queueing simulation in Matlab

This is an M/M/s queue simulation.
The overall architecture is event driven.

The main class is `ServiceQueue`.
It maintains a list of events, ordered by the time that they occur.
There is one `Arrival` scheduled at any time that represents the arrival of the next customer.
